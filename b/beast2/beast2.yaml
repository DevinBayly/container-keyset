    BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian inference using MCMC of molecular sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted,
       time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies
       but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology.
